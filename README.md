# My NeoVim Config

As I'm getting into NeoVim and creating a more and more complicated setup, I want to have a repo that can be easily imported into my system

Setup
=

Dependencies
-

Use the appropriate means to install neovim - Fedora example:

`sudo dnf install neovim `

**TODO**

Installation
-

Backup existing NeoVim files. Then clone the repo into the config NeoVim folder:

`git clone https://github.com/MichaelHarrisCode/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim`
